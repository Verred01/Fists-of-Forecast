# Fists of Forecast

# Description
This is a repository for an API based application that uses two APIs to tell you a Chuck Norris joke and the weather based on a ZIP code that you enter. The most recent ZIP codes you enter will show up in the sidebar and the joke can be generated even without using a ZIP code. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website can be used to view the weather and generate a Chuck Norris joke for fun. This is also a group class project to be used for grading and reviewing that we did the assignment correctly.
